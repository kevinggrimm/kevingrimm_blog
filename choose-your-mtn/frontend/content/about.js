    "When a reporter asked English mountaineer George Mallory why he wanted to climb Everest, he famously replied 'Because it's there'. I suspect that Indie Hackers co-founder Channing Allen would agree that Mallory's worldview aligns with his personal philosophy of 'To live a great life, live a great story'.",
    "The mountains that we choose to climb are connected to our stories."
